                       <p>The ENGLISH 57 course met as a seminar inside a windowless attic room of Margaret Jacks Hall, a room that I've actually taught computer science in before, funnily enough. Once upon a time, I was explaining a programming problem about Roman numerals, explaining how to convert them into numerical digits with JavaScript, yada yada. The room is more table than floor, and not very fun to navigate around, though neither is Margaret Jacks, the perennial holder of the "Main Quad building Ben gets lost in the most" award, because its architecture design is as simple and straightforward as a James Joyce narrative. The class was on Friday afternoons, which meant that two hours, medieval manuscripts, a half-working projector, and freshly baked carrot cakes were all that stood between me and a pint of Guinness and five hours of Mario Kart. It was like Layered Landscapes all over again.</p>

                       <p>Unfortunately, my physical notes from class are not extensive or legible. I'm aware that terms such as "visual learner" are outdated and not grounded in unanimous scholarship, but still, I like learning from pictures, and I like teaching with pictures, diagrams, and Expo marker "art". That's just how I do things: every sheet of paper is an oil canvas, and a white board is an ice rink for my fingertips to skate decoratively in spirals and axels and flower petals. If one saw me doodling surreptiously in class, covering my journal with my other hand out of shame, I promise that I was indeed taking notes: sketches of the various manuscripts being passed around, arrows layered over the global spread of the printing press, drawings of characters etched on divine oracle bones and porcelain bowls. That being said, the images appear, after a Friday night out, completely incomprehensible, like logographs of an extinct language. Oh well, I tried something new and failed‚Äîthat's learning. Consequently, this section will be less a direct reconstruction of course material, and more an imperfect, simmering brew of memory, myth, history, and personal reflections on topics and concepts I found the most salient and interesting. I'll also include outside scholarship and my own research‚Äîby that, I mean doom-scrolling on my phone while lying in supine position, occasionally arching up to drink an iced matcha latte at Verve Coffee Roasters, because that's how <s>all</s> most of my work gets done nowadays.</p>

                       <p>Overall, my favorite part of class was actually the professor's penchant for evangelizing the <em>Oxford English Dictionary (OED)</em>, and talking about the etymologies of various words, e.g., page, pagination, paper, leaf, amanuensis. Funnily enough, during my junior year, when I trying to get into a daily rhythm of writing and reading literature, I spent half an hour each morning on the online <em>OED</em>. I spidered through old and cob-webbed words, archaic sayings, their etymological lineage, and entertained ways I could daisy-chain them into my writing. I had a mini notebook where I recorded a new word on each line (i.e. words I have no business ever using, like <em>syzygy, Saturnine, bedizened, eldritch, prolix, lugubrious, alembicate, grandiloquent, brainrot, etc.</em>), along with its definition, and a brief enumeration of interesting synonyms. I thought that made me an uber nerd and completely unrespectable (and it probably did). But it turns I have a friend who does the same thing; I got brunch with her one morning, I mentioned it in passing, and apparently she does the same thing, and I think it actually made us closer as friends‚Äîthat we both read dictionaries for fun. Heck, the power of friendship is really something, alchemizing strange, strange behaviors into a feeling celebratory and perfectly normal. Validation.</p>

                        <h3>The History and Future of the Book</h3>

                        <p>I love books (who doesn't), and I'm so enthralled by them I forget that there weren't always books around: after all, the world's literacy rate during the Jurassic Period was an utterly astonishing 0%, which is probably what a lot of humanities professors think STEM classes look like. But before modern books, there were codices (fancy, intimidating word, but kinda cool). The word codex, according to the <em>OED</em>, originates from the Latin <em>caudex</em>, meaning the trunk of a tree, or a wood block, a fitting testament to the form and visual heft of ancient codices, which were typically large, large volumes of papyrus, parchment, or vellum skin pages fastened together at a single edge [1]. Pages weren't always bound together. And thus, neither was the written word, information itself. Codices were the first manuscript books‚Äî<em>manuscript,</em> meaning hand-written, from the prefix <em>manu</em> for hand, and the suffix <em>scriptus</em> for written binding together at a spine‚Äîand their support for page binding and long-form writing made them an immensely popular, versatile replacement for traditional scrolls and clay tablets. They were transformative, game-changing, power lines for the faster, denser transmission of knowledge. But they were still hand-written [2], which meant that Microsoft Word and Cardinal Print at the time didn't support them, an aspect that scholars and codicologists use to distinguish them from modern, mass-printed books.

                        <p>Typically, when I've seen manuscript codices up close, at museums, special archives, or national libraries, they've been trapped behind glass like pinned blue butterflies. I can't touch them, feel the old, wizened parchments, examine their contents. I don't imagine they are many extant codices that are still largely intact, and perhaps it's a valid security measure that my clumsiness and penchant for pyrotechnics (i.e. Ben in chemistry lab) doesn't get anywhere near them. I might be an archivist's worst nightmare. But what I do know, even from a distance, is that this protective yet grandiloquent display of each codex has to be curatorially intentional for reasons beyond primitive security. They feel impressive, imposing and enigmatic for a reason.

                        <p><em>(Left) The <u>Codex Sinaitacus</u>, a historical treasure which is a 4th century manuscript of the Christian Bible, written in Greek, and believed to be the oldest extant biblical codex. It was discovered at St. Catherine's Monastery, near the base of Mount Sinai, first in 1844 with 43 of its resilient leaves, and hundreds more leaves were unearthed in 1859. The largest extant part was subsequently sold to the British Museum, where it resides today [3] (Right) The <u>Codex Gigas</u>, or colloquially the Devil's Bible, is a large, renowned 13th-century manuscript, famed for its full-leaf illustration of the devil (see image above). Believed to be the world's largest extant illuminated codex, it is currently held at the National Library of Sweden, though it originated from the Benedictine monasteries of Bohemia, a historical region of the present-day Czech Republic [4]. </em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>These codices are, certainly, emblems of the historical canon and early civilization, charged with both symbolic power and the ancestral heirloom which is cultural heritage. Expensive, elaborate codices were largely commissioned for works of high prestige, spiritual purpose, and readership, such as the Bible (and its manifold translations), liturgical books to be read for prayer at cathedrals, and large choir books. There was immense selectivity and curation involved in the process. A work such as <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> or <em>The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3D</em> would have never made the cut, despite being (in my opinion) of great post-modern literary merit. It's only fitting perhaps that bookmakers would adorn these renowned texts with inspiringly large-size, large-font, large-margin, decorative-cover megaliths of books. The presentation of the codices in museum exhibits also intrigues me‚Äîalmost always, the codex is not closed-book, but open, unfurled to a page (usually, a recognizable one for scholars and aficionados). There's typically not an easy way to observe other pages of the manuscript, besides rarified online digitization. There's a kind of symbolism to this discreetness, I think, related to this notion of history as a collective memory that's only partially ajar, revealed in page fragments, an iceberg sliver of the past with much that has to be uncovered. Like the bottom seafloor of the ocean, the volcano-strewn surface of Mars, or the stars stretching to infinity before us, the fact that we can only see so little of it compounds the manuscript's aura, its tangible sense that we are witnessing a grand relic of human, wordly existence.</p>

                        <p>The successor to codices is the modern book, galvanized by the printing press in 15th century, kudos to Johannes Gutenberg, then mechanization and the mass industrialization of book-making. I don't have anything very profound to say about books or the printing press, but it does make me think about this one episode of the legal TV series <em>Suits</em> I was watching lately, with the remote on, my brain off. In a particular scene, a Harvard trivia contest, the protagonist Mike Ross is asked the question "what's the oldest book in the Harvard library?". He answers "the Bible", only to be corrected by the host, who insists he's wrong, that it's the <em>Gutenberg Bible</em>, not "<em>the Bible</em>." Mike retorts that everyone knows that it's the Gutenberg Bible, that he didn't have to specify. At this point, I'm jolted awake, almost screaming at the TV, "they're the same exact thing, you pedantic, miserable piece of‚Äî"</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Perhaps they're both right. The Gutenberg Bible is the Bible, and yet, the <em>Gutenberg</em> modifier does crucially signify its relative modernity, its  production and circulation through standardized printing technologies, rather than being uniquely styled and lavished by its scribes. <b>A fact that ENGLISH 57 really got across to me was just how radically different the experience of manuscript handwriting is</b>, from poring over gigantic volumes with hundreds and hundreds of pages that were astonishingly and meticulously written by hand, to trying to write ourselves with an ink and quill on vellum skin, which, at least for me, was less than auspicious. I couldn't even write my name (typically the only thing I do right on exams), so that was a bit rock bottom. In fact, give me an entire year to train, a luxuriant rainforest of scratch paper, a grand fountain pen of youth, and I still don't believe I can produce a single page of a medieval codex‚Äîor anything even close. <b>Whether printer blocks, iron gall ink blots, or writer's block, the medium, the vigilant script through which language and meaning is unfurled onto the page really does matter.</b> And it can also help us better understand the history and human craft of book-making, and its evolution into the mass, supply-chain, BookTok-catalyzed industry we know today.</p>
 
                        <p>It also made me contemplate whether the digital age, in half a century, has ushered in such a radical sea change to the ways we encounter and experience language and information‚Äîthat existing scholarly frameworks for manuscripts and the textual book may require significant revision and reinvention. A <em>book</em> can refer to a medieval codex, a modern physical hardcopy, grainy photographs of a book compiled into a PDF, a text-formatted eBook on the Internet (with an adjustable dial for 8pt,10pt,12pt font sizes, and for your selection of <em>Times New Roman, Arial, Garamond, Palatino</em>), or a picture book where pastel-colored illustrations surrogate for text. And if a book is loosely defined as a bound collection of pages, any website, or HTML harbor with hypertext navigation ships to faraway regions of the Internet will do. Can a book be dynamic, mutable like web content? (obligatory mention of the <em>Ship of Theseus</em> here) What precisely is a <em>manuscript</em> now? Writers and academics will often say <em>manuscript</em> to refer to drafts, incomplete or unpolished versions of their craft, an almost crude metaphor for the handwritten word that so elegantly embellished works of medieval antiquity, produced by devoted scribes who mastered their penmanship over decades in mountainous monasteries. But typed works now are the scholarly cachet, the hot stuff <em>(in fact, there's a running joke in mathematics that just because the math is typed in LaTeX, an elegant, ornate type-setting software, then it's immediately correct. It can't be wrong; the formatting is too nice. I will say, without rigorous statistics or A/B testing, that my typed p-sets seemingly get nicer, more benefit-of-the-doubt grading than my handwritten papers)</em>.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps I'm just cherry-picking at tiny details, whorls, and frills of language, but I can't escape the sense that unfortunately physical hand-writing is diminishing in prestige, its long-held value as an art form. <b>I do think the physical, material book will stay; however, there may be ramifications to consider as they become increasingly tied to digitization, computer technologies, online media, and the vast, nebulous, infinite-entropy Internet.</b>

                        <h3>Manuscript Materials and Handwriting</h3>
                        <p>Medieval manuscripts have been the progeny of a great variety of minds and materials. The latter included parchment from animal skin and high-quality calfskin vellum (which was laborious to prepare, though it was smooth, sturdy, and durable, and one could readily write on both sides of the sheet) to write upon, and bird feather quills and a small inkwell filled with dark iron gall or walnut ink as instruments to write with. </p>

                        <p>Writing on manuscript materials‚Äîin my case, in class, parchment with a frayed ink quill‚Äîwas very difficult, and made me acutely aware of just how much I take my ability to write <em>legibly</em> for granted. It's not trivial at all, this craft and glowing gift of handwriting, even though, for most students, it's a skill acquired around first or second grade. I'm especially aware of this when I'm studying another language such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese, where the writing systems are very different from English, with the syllabary-based Hiragana and Katakana for Japanese, and thousands of often intricate, thousand-year-old Kanji characters in both languages. I remember feeling humbled, though perhaps not astonished, when I couldn't remember basic characters or pen strokes, was clueless which characters followed which ones, and ended up feeling sunken and defeated by the whole endeavor‚Äîthis empty, empty, empty paper before me. </p>

                        <p><b>The class made me reflect more on handwritting as also a modern, evolving technology of language, just like typing, texting, emojis, GIFs, and not as a vestigial, aging practice.</b> A observation was made in class regarding the very word <em>spelling</em>, which makes writing sound like casting spells and hexes and enchantments, like magic and sorcery, which to some extent is true. Handwriting is still everywhere, from signatures to verify our human existence, to writing notes, exams, essays, and assignments in schools (whether written on paper or tablet, it's a common saying that handwriting improves memory retention over typing), to notebooks and diaries and records of our personal and collective histories, and from the lugubrious crawl of filling out paperwork to the crowning joy of receiving a letter from a loved one. And there really is nothing like a moving handwritten note, delivered on a birthday, holiday, or any day, where you can witness, with every swirl of a letter, capital, or illustration, the author's will and dedication that blossomed onto the page, and onto you.</p>

                        <h3>Dating Manuscripts</h3>
                        <p>Dating is hard, and sometimes it's the littlest darn things that make or break it, like not noticing the subtlest of letter cursives and ornamentations on the page that screams 12th century; a bright, glossy, emerald-green miniature with 13th century European brushstrokes; big blocky <em>Times New Roman</em> style letters that signify, well, Roman Empire, somewhere in its centurial, mercurial lifespan; or a contemporary script at the twilight of <em>pax manuscripta</em>, right before the emergence of the Gutenberg printing press. It's a complex laboratory science, manuscript dating and paleographic study, and it's very challenging to be needle-precise with years, even decades. With dating, any mistake, any flaw can seemingly set one back (or forward) years. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In ENGLISH 57, we had a class where each of us was given four scans, each corresponding to a different manuscript from a different time; the objective was to at least sort the manuscript leaves by date relative to one another, and, as a bonus, to ballpark the century or even decade it was composed. We were allowed to talk in pairs, which was enormously fortunate, as I had essentially no experience with paleography or dating manuscripts. I ended up sorting the manuscripts with the highly rigorous, peer-reviewed, avant-garde method of "big blocky font" to "swirly whirlpool font and cursive" i.e. from <em>Times New Roman</em> to <em>Apple Chancery</em>. <b>Somehow, this worked. </b> Math insists there's a 1 out of 24 chance in getting this randomly correct, like landing a double pair in poker, so that felt good, if not incredibly fraudulent. Nevertheless, a fascinating discussion followed afterward, with the chronologies of script and languages (e.g., Old English, Middle English, Latin, etc.), the emergence of certain symbols or puncutation which could be a significant clue, to layout considerations such as two-column manuscript leaves, and when they were in vogue.</p>

                        <p>Though I imagine pinpointing the exact year, or a decadal interval, must require arduous, meticulous research and inquiry, including interrogation of the text itself and intertextual allusions and memories. But even approximating dates within a century was exciting, astonishing really from applying üîé "Inspect Element" to the handwriting style, examining the script with a magnifying glass, and taking that holistic approach which we call <em>intuition, or that's what my gut tells me</em>. It just looks 13th century, Gothic script, and guess what, it is!!</p>
