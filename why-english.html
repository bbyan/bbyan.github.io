                        <h2 id = "why-english">🎨 Why English (57); Or, the Motive and the Cue for Manuscript Study</h2> 
    
                        <p>Why English? This is a question I get asked a lot, and it's a very fair question. My background is in Computer Science and Mathematics, the subjects I majored in, and ostensibly that life force carried into my master's program, where I'm studying computer science with a theoretical focus. I also taught two CS classes this autumn, one as a lecturer, the other as a head TA, and I really do love my job, teaching students about algorithms, data structures, and introductory programming. At times, I can see computer science as my future, tangible and real, not a shimmering mirage, and perhaps the world is giving me every sign to leave everything else behind and pursue this. A storybook future in gold-leaved, high-flying Silicon Valley. Surely, I have my life figured out, every tarnish and failure buried inside the hourglass of time.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Life, unlike myth, does not offer that kind of narrative clarity. I also minored in Creative Writing during my lifespan as an undergrad (2020-2024), and it was the hardest and most necessary thing I did academically, which tends to surprise a lot of people. Especially my dear friends over in STEM. But it didn't surprise me greatly when I first began. I entered the  world of Stanford Humanities at a painful nadir of my life. Like many students, I was adrift and ship-wrecked by my first two years of undergrad: a disaster of anxiety, loneliness, suicidal depression, overloaded course schedules, and a crushing, capsizing sense that I was severely underperforming—and that I didn't deserve to be here. I felt fraudulent, and sought either psychological validation for being a fraud, or to discover a subject that could actually give me joy, that I felt I belonged in. I wanted happiness (who doesn't?), which at the time I didn't think learning was about: what I had in mind then was a rat race of status ladder-climbing and professional shape-shifting into a hireable, corporately desirable mold. Yikes.</p> 

                        <p>Writing has been as much repairing my relationship with learning, as healing and reconciling with the way I perceive myself. My therapist had recommended I find something, anything that could give me relief and joy, that could spirit me away, and writing thankfully emerged into that role. Like many students, the humanities, the arts offered me a therapeutic, emotionally open and panoramic space to give voice to my undesirable thoughts and feelings. It began in short, safe snippets I wrote, softened before they became painful, to full-blown paragraphs with all sorts of sharp slicing edges and steel screws loose. <b>Writing soon became more than an interest activity. It became a necessity. I wasn't any good at it, but I needed to write.</b> By writing, I told myself that I wanted to live, that I wanted to leave behind something material and real. That was my contract with the page: I was going to stamp it with part of myself, my being. It was a pressure valve for the dark, destructive engine in my head, and yet, certainly there was a price to be paid for it, a minus in the double-entry bookkeeping which is life. Emotional overdependence on your work and craft is one thing. And yes, it's a problem for me, and one that I have to account for. But as I'm sure we're all aware, simply writing, writing is just so damn hard (excuse my language).</p>

                        <p>Beyond losing sleep over workshop nightmares or not being able to come up with the right word in a sentence, but being so close, writing can require emotional risk-taking, personal exposure, and pure, perilous creativity to an extent that no other academic practice demands. I recall agonizing about this one work I submitted to Prof. Elizabeth Tallent and Prof. Nina Schloesser Tárano's class, showing up in front of everyone in tears—as I decided, last minute, I wasn't comfortable with the story that was slipping through my hands like sand, and I had zero alternative for workshop then. I was going to flunk (thanks to their compassion, I didn't). In retrospect, I don't think what I wrote was that personally vulnerable or hazardous (though in terms of craft and confidence, it was absolute rock bottom). But this is before I wrote about mental health as brazenly and shamelessly as I do now. And there's a very valid critique that all my stories now are the same: a YA Asian-American coming-of-age where the son is good at math and has depression, the sister is not good at math and has depression (indicating being good or not at math has no correlation with mental well-being), actually everyone in the family has depression, but it's ok in the end because there's some grand, Dickens-like reconcilation around the holidays, and the sleigh bell joy is so infectious it slays hell, and everyone realizes they have to spent a bit more time pursuing joy for joy's sake, and maybe things will work out. Vapid, I know right?</p>

                        <p>I read Sylvia Plath's <em>The Bell Jar</em> and some of her poetry early in high school, but it'd wasn't until college and in my blues, riding my bike around campus alone at 2 AM, freezing occasionally to glance up at the icy stars, that the words really struck me. I listen to Phoebe Bridgers when I'm down, and her lyrics have meshed and interlocked in my head into a kind of safety net. During National Novel Writing Month last year—a feat that my stint in Creative Writing is most notorious for—I wrote two novels (50,000 words each) in one month, a blazing, supernova pace made possible only by an unquenchable need for catharsis. It was the first time at Stanford I really felt in control of my abilities, and really felt that I was doing the best I could. Sure, the novels were execrable, unreadable, but having written so freely, so vitally is what mattered. It's is the closest thing to a PhD dissertation I've ever done, and it led to burnout and writer's block for an entire year afterward.</p>

                        <p>My senior winter, I went abroad to experience something different, over at Oxford, and felt much happier because of it. I ditched the MacOS UNIX terminal, my synthwave-themed code editor, and commited myself to a university Tutorial in Creative Writing. I wrote flash fiction, stories in diary form and in the second-person, dabbled in poetry. I remember on a hasty train ride to Stonehenge (should have been a bus ride, but funny story for another time), I was looking out the window, at a convoy of heavy white clouds hovering over the England countryside, like something in a Charlotte Brontë novel. An idea for a poem suddenly beckoned to me. I pulled out a journal, switched off my ear buds, and began to write: every stanza became a memory swirled into a word cloud, all cascading downwards like terrifying infinite falling anvils. It was an awful, incoherent poem, really (I forgot what it was about), but it was bloody fun to write. Then, there was the Powerpoint story I wrote (better word, attempted) for Prof. Kirstin Valdez-Quade's Advanced Fiction course the spring term. I really should have had the "interesting" story form—forty crayon-colored slides in lieu of real dignified prose—approved before submitting to workshop, but oh well. <b>The trickery was worth the look on everyone's face, like "yeah of course, Ben did this."</b>

                        <p>My life has been much better over the last year, I'd say, holistically speaking. I finally graduated, with a group of friends that I dearly love, hauled two majors and a minor across the finish line (somehow). I spent the summer doing climate research at Berkeley; the hours were gentle, and I rode a BART train every weekend into San Francisco, where I reincarnated as a child—winning anime toys from lottery machines, buying figurines if I couldn't win them, and savoring ice cream from a terrace while the sunset brought down the sky. I ditched the <em>New Yorker</em>, <em>The Paris Review</em>, and literary fiction for few months, immersing myself in illustrated manga stories about superheroes, cursed spirits, sea-faring buccaneers, demon slayers, and sorcerers fighting in Tokyo. Stories really can save us, it turns out. On the Fourth of July, I boarded a red-eye flight to New York, and all in one day, went bookstore hopping with a friend (<em>Strand</em>, the original <em>Barnes and Noble</em>, <em>Kinokuniya</em>); roamed around Manhattan Chinatown for hours, ran into and got a picture with a celebrity; went city-biking in Central Park and through the holiday traffic into Times Square; ate in Koreatown; saw the fireworks in a jam-packed crowd near the harbor. It was a wild time. When I got back, I tried Chinese calligraphy for fun, wrote a hundred characters every early morning. I began reading and writing fiction in Mandarin for the first time. None of it was very fruitful, but that didn't really matter. <b>I didn't think about dying as regularly, daily as I used to. Just what the next crazy, unexpected, adventurous, "for the plot" thing I was going to do with my life.</b></p>
 
                        <p>The humanities had saved me, really. And I didn't have to be a good writer or a very good student for that happen. I just had to be around.</p>

                        </div>

                          </p>
                        
                        <p>Though I often contemplated going the full distance and majoring in English, I never did. Mostly because I was scared of it. I knew that the major in its entirety would be too formidable and challenging for me, in the sense that I to this day don't trust myself to write a publishable short story, or an academic essay on any jewel of the English literary canon. I don't think I have the mind, the sagacity for it. In any case, I probably made the right call. Triangulating three subjects in my undergrad nearly ripped me apart, drawn and quarter-system style, and having to produce great insights on Shakespeare, Beowulf, or Chaucer on top of that would have finished the job. </p> 

                        <p>This is not to say that I have complete irreverence for literature. I love literature! It's how I got invested in Creative Writing in the first place; one of my favorite quotes on writing is from the author Saul Bellow, who said "a writer is a reader who is moved to emulation." I am moved constantly as I read. By tales of love, togetherness, failure, redemption, determination, and every emotion pulsing in between. I don't think that writing as art, and writing as a science, a laboratory of literary critique, are inherently at odds with one another. At my core, I'm a prose stylist—I care as much about plot, characters, as how each sentence is engineered, the electric ways words and phrases are strung into wires and fuses and fireworks—and by reading and critiquing novels, works of fiction and poetry, I'm learning from the best: in my mind, Sylvia Plath, Vladimir Nabokov, Virgina Woolf, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and most recently, Ocean Vuong, Ottessa Moshfegh, Zadie Smith, David Foster Wallace, George Saunders, Lauren Groff, Jennifer Egan, and Emily St. John Mandel. I may not know what a sestina or an aubade or lyric poetry or who Ted Hughes is, but there's this line from Vuong's magnificent poem, <em>Someday I'll Love Ocean Vuong</em>, that goes:</p>

                        <div style = "text-align: center">
                        <p><em>Ocean. Ocean — / get up. The most beautiful part of your body / is where it's headed</em></p>
                        <p><em>& remember, / loneliness is still time spent with the word."</em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>and it absolutely fucks with me, twists the knife into my guts and makes me want to cry, and that's how I know it's poetry.</p>

                        <p>But I had perhaps more compelling, immediate reasons to believe I wasn't ready for the major (despite my humanities roommate's exhortations), namely the core literary requirements. It's not as though I don't want to learn about Shakespeare's tragedies, the sublime in <em>Frankenstein</em>, or ruined castles and ruined characters in Gothic novels, et cetera. I just don't think I would have done very well. I have no working knowledge of Old English, Middle English, Latin, Greek, Anglo-Norman, Welsh, Old Norse, and other vernacular languages; in other words, when it comes to the court of older literature or medieval manuscripts, I'm effectively illiterate, each sentence taking around a life sentence to read. Back in high school AP English, we read <em>Beowulf</em> and <em>Grendel</em>, and I was so helpless and useless in discussion I was practically pleading for <em>Hamlet</em> or <em>Romeo & Juliet</em>. Not that the difference would have been vast. I struggle to parse really any literature written before the 1900s, an umbrella that includes Shakespeare. And Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, John Milton, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Peter Bysshe Shelley, and so on (that "pre-1800s literature class" requisite looks like a ghoulish nightmare to me.) What a pity. In a way, I'm only a hunter-gatherer of very contemporary works of literature (i.e. BookTok, movie adaptations starring Kenneth Branagh), and more or less completely fraudulent, intellectually seedless if someone asks me about anything printed in a Penguin Classics book.</p> 

                        <p>"<em>Great Expectations</em>? Yeah, never heard of her."</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Do I belong in the humanities then?</b> Maybe, I think I still do, and in spite of my very clear incompetence and jester qualities, I have felt welcome in every humanities class and arts community I've been apart of. That is meaningful. But I do want to study literature more deeply and comprehensively, and it's a real shame that I wasn't good enough as an undergrad to do so—though <b>I suppose that's where no longer being an undergrad comes in handy.</b> I graduated in June 2024, and though I dreaded leaving the bright-green chrysalis which is a bachelor's program, and having to actually do something with my life afterward, I've felt strangely liberated since then. The pressure to graduate on-time, to take an escalating debt of course units has evacuated. It's made way I think for slower, more gradual scholarship and meditation. I have two full years for the master's, and I've had a wicked idea at times to Trojan Horse a phantom English degree out of it, as I have abundant unit space for "elective" courses. I'm also contemplating this at a very weak, lethargic spell in my writing career. I haven't written a short story or poem in months, and the piping-hot engine that once powered two novels in thirty days has completely cooled, exhausted itself. Every indication is  that I should just give up, pull the plug on my humanities experiment—that this fever dream of publishing a short story in <em>The New Yorker</em>, or inking a maiden YA novel deal with <em>Penguin Random House</em> needs to end, for my sake. It's probably the reasonable thing to do. I was never a particularly strong writer, and the ratio of my passion to my knowledge of literature is the speed of light, fleeting, unreachable. </p>

                        <p><b>Well, it's a good thing I don't make objectively good decisions in life.</b> Literature and stories have always been about feeling less alone inside, and less alone when walking to the altar of death—and I don't wish to imagine my life without learning and breathing literature. Even if I don't manage to marry my programming and humanities interests, I think that both will serve me well in academia and life. In a way, I see my early teaching career as a descendant of a humanities lineage: everything I'v learned about speaking with verve and lumonsity, expressing my thoughts clearly, synthesizing texts and knowledge, and connecting with the shared experiences and lives of other people has been instrumental to me this quarter. Two things that I'm proud of: I've never denied an extension request, and I energetically listen to and keep track of what students tell me about their lives—the courses they're taking, how their first weeks of Stanford have been and adjusting to college, what they're thinking about studying, and so forth in that vast beautiful, frightening tree which is possibility.</p> 

                        <p>I remember in Week 8, for a class on mental health I was teaching for my 1-unit CS106S: Coding for Social Good seminar, I decided to experiment with a writing prompt at the start. Wild stuff. I had no idea if it was going to work out. The prompt, borrowed from Nina Schloesser Tárano, essentially asked students about the ways we've been atrophied or damaged by our education: that for all the gifts, opportunity, and protection it's brought, <em>what has being good at school cost us?</em> I also vowed they did not have to share anything they wrote, that they could keep the paper to themselves, folded inward like a personal origami. I attempted the prompt alongside them, wrote about anxiety and depression, and it was a surreal, trance-like ten minutes, half of which I spent thinking, "darn, I'm really not qualified to lead a psychology or humanities seminar, so this is kind of borderline irresponsible. I'm such an idiot." Thankfully, it worked out, even though I am an idiot. <b>I talked to my students after class, and I was relieved to know they not only appreciated the prompt—the chance to really sit down, have a respite from their coursework, and write—but told me they were very interested in taking English and the humanities heading forward.</b> This was an effort that mattered to them. That was incredibly exciting and heartening for me to hear (though it doesn't help the very fair criticism that I'm a part-time CS lecturer/TA moonlighting as a Stanford Humanities recruiting double agent).</p>

                        <p>But if I have to sacrifice a course or two or three about hardware-accelerating graphics or quantum ciphers to really study Shakespeare beyond the mythos, Beowulf slaying the dragon, chasing the unreachable green light in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> (my all-time favorite novel), and what it means to be alive and kicking, I'll do so. Fair game.</p>

                        <p>So why <b>English 57: Meaning and Medieval Manuscripts</b> this autumn in particular? It's not that long of a story, I promise. Last autumn, I read this 600-page cinder block of a novel by Anthony Doerr, <em>Cloud Cuckoo Land</em>, and it was this wonderful, long, globe-spanning, time continuum-breaking work of humanism. The sheer research that went into the novel—its basis in Ancient Greek texts and codices, fables, and old, ephemeral manuscripts—must have been immense. After flipping the last page, I went on Instagram and straight to Anthony Doerr's account, where I stumbled upon a fascinating manuscript (image below), the paper  fringed and archipelagoed like ancient coastlines. It got me intrigued about manuscripts and medieval artifacts, and more broadly, stimulated my interest in learning more about stories at the root. The Greek mythologies; the Arthurian legends behind the knights in shining armor, the Excalibur sword gleaming in the rock; the saga of Sun Wukong (Monkey King) in <em>Journey to the West</em>, and its enduring inspiration for Chinese and East Asian storytelling. I wanted a paleographic, anthropological lens on the story. On fiction. And why not begin, I thought, from the very earliest scripts, the first written recordings and manuscripts of oral storytelling, with ENGLISH 57. Certainly, there's the factor that I knew some students in the seminar, not to mention the professor, from my study abroad cohort. <b>And enrolling in an English seminar had an important symbolic purpose: that I'm not done with the world of humanities yet, even as I'm deeply unsure of my place in it.</b></p>

                        <b>In short, I honestly don't know what I'm doing, pretty much all the time, but after graduation and the ghostly green haze that's been the last four years, that's seemed more alright than ever.</b></p>

                        <p>It's funny. As a head TA, I've been asked about courses, majors/co-term programs, extracurriculars, and Stanford advice more times than the past four years combined. And everytime I answer, I feel like I'm disassociating, slipping into the third-person, that I'm watching this fraud salesman who's made awful decisions his entire life tender advice to kind, excited, brilliant frosh. I really do hope they trust me, but I wouldn't blame them if they (astutely) perceived that I was full of shit. But in many ways, this is the story of higher ed, that inevitable, gravitationally crushing feeling of imposter syndrome, that nothing you've achieved measures up to the sky-high standard, the planetary laws of success—and I'm certainly no exception, no sui generis.</p>

                        <p>"Yes, I believe you should major in CS! Of course, explore around, see what you love, but don't give up on CS over one course!" <em>(I do truly believe this, as my students are amazing and the best. They're inspiring me every day with their determination, their daring and force of life. But it's also true I literally quit CS for an entire year, as in took zero CS classes because they no longer gave me any joy or meaning then—and instead studied poetry, and went abroad to study more poetry, so I'm kind of a hypocrite)</em> </p>

                        <p>"What's your advice for doing well in CS107? (the course on computer systems I'm TAing this winter, and the third course in Stanford's intro programming sequence)" (<em>So my little dark secret is that I actually nearly failed 107—I'm not talking about an A-, I mean I was literally a borderline C grade, damaged by a 25% and 40% on two crucial projects. That was painful, humiliating. It severely wrecked my confidence, until I eventually took a deep breath, enrolled in the successor course CS 110, and ended up performing much better somehow, thankfully. But if my students can't trust anything I say about 107, I wouldn't blame them; though if I can help a student who was in the same distraught, dark place I was in, I'll consider my failures redeemed in a way.</em>)</p>

                        <p>"What made you decide to pursue computer science?" (<em>I've honestly tried to leave CS every quarter I've been here, and would have abandoned it long ago if it weren't for my amazing, compassionate advisor—a senior CS lecturer—who still believed in me, despite having every reason not to. He trusted me despite my declining record, my destructive lack of confidence, a growing sense that I was going to defect into the arts and English literature, and the undeniable hard truth that CS was my worst subject among the three I was actively pursuing. Things have greatly changed since then, but still, in many aspects, I don't see myself as good or qualified enough to teach computer science here. But it's very empowering, emotionally moving that he believes in me. The opportunities he's given me to TA and teach have been life-changing—and ultimately, it's up to my wonderful students whether they have faith in me or not, which is the way it should be.)</em> 

                        <p>At times, I feel like, if one will, this very old manuscript that's chalked with dust and grime and mottled with ink corrosion, that wanted to be a star chart, a map to the grand frontier of dreams. This is my fifth year at Stanford. I can safely say I have a lot of experience being a student, whether as a success story or, more often, interminable, laughable failure. We all have our skeletons in the closet, the unflattering matters we try to hide away. But still, I was wary that my students, if they knew that I'm a complete joker of a person, that I consider myself to this day an academic failure, that I'm seen among people who know me more as a cautionary tale, an emblem of self-destructiveness, then they would lose confidence in me as a teacher.</p> 
                        
                        <p>I'm wrong. I know that I'm wrong because I saw it happen, on my first week of teaching this quarter: whether it was because of a week of grisly sleep deprivation or just being nervous (stage fright), I suffered a panic attack in the middle of lecture. It was like the others I had privately: I could barely see, my vision was honey-combing and abstracting away into blurry, blurry shapes, and I felt was literally drowning in a gasoline pool of lights, sweat, and concerned stares. Yikes. I stepped outside for nearly twenty minutes, and thought, well, that's the end of my short-lived teaching career. It's gone, vapor, smoke. Because how am I supposed to go back to class after that? Well, astonishingly, between that lecture and the next one, I gained two net students, took better care of myself, and went on a comet streak of fun classes, discussions, and activites, culminating in an end-quarter boba party. My inaugural official teaching evaluations, which just released yesterday, have been very very uplifting, at 4.81/5.0 as a CS head TA and 4.78/5.0 as a lecturer. My aim is to keep improving into this winter, while not forgetting that teaching is supposed to be a trial and learning experience. There's roughness to it. It's not supposed to be perfectly smooth and sable.<p>

                        <p>I was wrong about my fears, and I feel bad that I underestimated my student's empathy, their recognition of a shared current of anxiety, and their essential compassion and understanding. I take none of it for granted. The very fact that they, upon seeing me in that state, wouldn't think that I was untrustworthy, unqualified, a complete fraud. <b>They would just think I'm human.</b> That I'm trying my best, as they are. And this is what I know for sure. That teaching, even though I haven't figured it out, even if I'm not the best or most inspiring person for it, is going to be the story I author for my life going forward, simply because I love it—and I want to keep doing it. If I'm going to leave anything behind here, it'll be any knowledge, support, and hopefully any joy I contributed to my students.</p>

                        <p>The manuscripts we saw in class too were made by someone who couldn't find the holy grail and was just trying to live a little longer, and after many hundreds of years, the pages are broken, damp, tattered, breviary leaves falling away from the spine like wings on a dying butterfly. The manuscripts are barely alive, desiccated by fate. They're also beautiful. Beautiful in their totality, their enduring, palimpsestic qualities, and their resilience to certain death. And they're a joy to behold and read.</p> 

                        <p><b>Tl;dr This is why I'm here, for better or for worse, for joy, and with it, meaning</b></p>
