                        <h2 id="memory-leaves">üçÉ Memory Leaves (Manuscripts, Ancient Artifacts, and Miniatures from My Quarto Abroad)</h2>
                        <p>Though I first took a seminar devoted to medieval manuscripts this autumn, I was lightly exposed to manuscripts beforehand, first with the century-spanning Anthony Doerr novel (<em>Cloud Cuckoo Land</em>) I read last year, and then the wild, feverish quarter I enjoyed abroad in the United Kingdom. There, I spent as much time working on my Tutorial, reading contemporary poetry and writing contemptible poetry, as gallivanting around the country‚Äîtouring museums, libraries, art galleries, historical streets, and landmarks such as the Roman Baths, Stonehenge, Big Ben, and the Nando's on Cowley Road. Often, these activities were mandated (somewhat sternly, e.g., losing dessert privileges, a good 'ol scolding in WhatsApp) by the program, but they were sporadically born out of my own personal interest and desire for an "adventurous" experience. I recognize this is a roundabout excuse for not expending enough hours and energy working in Bodleian, and not submitting <s>some of</s> most of my assignments on time, but I don't possess many regrets. It was astonishing, really, to be within a Great Barrier Reef of historic sites, cultural heritage emblems, and big glittering artifacts that lay waiting, oystering with acclaim and preservation in museums. I intended to make the most of it. And to learn a lot of history stuff!</p>

                        <p>Consequently, for this website's penultimate chapter, we'll have what television writers call a <em>filler episode</em> or bottle episode (not <em>bottle</em> in the colloquial British sense when a lad's favorite team loses in the Premier, but as a metaphor for quick, cheap production values, like pulling an episode right out of a bottle in genie fashion). <b>In this case, a photo gallery, and reflections on my earliest major experiences with historical manuscripts, upholstered by a desire to capture my manuscript studies with totality and generous holisticity.</b> A website is a book of (web)pages, in a way, and I believe a holistic, anthropological approach is essential. Also, because my editor asked for it.</p>


                        <h3>ü™® Rosetta Stone</h3>
                        <p>Let's begin! The photograph below is from my first-ever visit to the Olympus-sized British Museum, and its complex circulatory system of hallways and stairwells, where moving from one room to the next can leap across entire centuries, continents, and cadaverous crevices, gaps in recorded history. One of the exhibits I really wanted to see was the <b>Rosetta Stone</b>, a slab of granodiorite rock with a royal Egyptian degree written in three distinct language scripts: the hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts of Ancient Egyptian, and Ancient Greek at the bottom. When I first saw the stone, surrounded by visitors, encased in a coffin of sharp military-grade glass, I was shocked by just how large and hefty it was. Like nearly as tall as me (I'm shorter than I look).</p> 

                        <div style = "display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">

                        <img src="images/rosetta.png" style="object-fit: cover;height:320px; border-radius:10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
                        
                        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2482.6620068429356!2d-0.12953152391867595!3d51.519416609826116!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x48761b323093d307%3A0x2fb199016d5642a7!2sThe%20British%20Museum!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1734766947474!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="360px" height="320px" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

                        </div>


                        <p>I'm not entirely sure if this historiographic object qualifies as a manuscript (certainly not medieval in any case), though the symbols on the stone are dutifully written and painstakingly chiseled by hand, with perfectly rectilinear spacing and organization. <b>But in any case, it provided an ample reminder of the scale, the dimensionality of manuscripts and paleographic study</b>, from quarto pages the size of laminated birthday cards, to  sheets and scrolls of papyrus, to large, biblical structures more akin to wall tapestries or megaliths in the solitary wilderness. Everything can be apart of the art, the diaphonous threads of knowledge and history woven into every fabric of the written word: scrolls, calfskin parchment, sheets adorned with small painted miniatures, codices, hand-scribed and printed books, and even massive ancient stones with dream-gray canyons of language. <b>There is so much out there to study.</b></p>

  
                        <h3>üìú Magna Carta</h3>
                        <p>The photographs below were taken during my inaugural visit to the British Library, toward the waning, plum-skied twilight of the quarter (Week 7 or so). Though a cybersecurity attack had devastated much of the library's digital infrastructure, its search databases, the physical library and shelves were still open to the public. We spent the first half of our time there in the  <b>Treasures Gallery</b> room, a darkly lit, ambient space home to rare books, illuminated manuscripts, resplendent maps with arterial blue lines, and even reams of medieval choir music. And within this invigilated room, like a Matryoshka nesting doll, was a smaller inner room devoted to the <b>Magna Carta (1215)</b>, a pivotal software update for Britain's age-gold operating philosophy that Kings held divine, unquestionable rule over their subjects. Two copies of the original Carta are held there (one badly tarnished by fire), with the others at the magnificent 13th century Salisbury Cathedral and the late 11th century Lincoln Castle.

                            <div style = "display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">

                        <img src="images/magna-carta.png" style="object-fit: cover;height:320px; border-radius:10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">

                        </div>

                        <p>The handwriting may be a bloody disaster, but the content of the writing is of upmost legal interest and adulation from scholars: its establishment of individual rights enshrined in law, such as fair trial and trial by jury, its clause that the monarchy too was subject to the rule of law, and its very genesis from a rebellion against the King. I was astonished to learn that four clauses of the Magna Carta remain in effect, to this day, in England and Wales, ancient words conjured from the gallows of history into taut, invisible laws circling the lives of people today. The 13th century Magna Carta isn't just some treasured relic of the past, inanimate and entombed in an archival display, but a living, lithe Frankenstein of parchment, which is probably why we continue to study it. It's still bloody alive!</p>

                        <p>That's kind of interesting, I think. With that in mind, I might actually study history again: I had this mindset that I was shite at history (and consequently the history of literature) because I'm so helpless at memorizing facts, old dates (e.g., when the Declaration of Independence was signed, if the Seven Years War was really 7 years or not, when Mozart wrote <em>Ode to Joy</em>), people, places, inventions, and who did what on a cold rainy night in Stoke. I'm probably still awful at it, but at least I have a chance if history is a more dynamic practice about identifying patterns and paradigms of change, along propulsive veins of cultural, sociological shifts, and interrogating the global,  bone-deep, evolving palimpsest which is the present world.</p>
                    </p>

                        <h3>üìñ Bible Manuscript Codex</h3>

                        <p>At least I'm 99% sure this is the Bible, based on extant manuscript leafs I've seen of it, though if it's not, you can ignore everything else I'll say here. I found this photo in my camera roll from the British Library collections, and as I'm thoroughly illitrate in medieval languages, I can't verify what book I'm looking at. But I'm pretty sure it's a rare handwritten Bible from the Middle Ages. And like the <b>Rosetta Stone</b> back the British Museum, I was awestruck by the size of the manuscript codex, with its very generous margins, font size, large separation between the text columns, and the decorative, colorful "drop caps" letters to commence each section. It's a very physically impressive and weighty object, which was ostensibly attractive to bookmakers for conveying with sheer materiality the import and prestige of the text inside, that is the very words of God. <b>Contemplating the book as a material, phenomenological object, viewed and interpreted continually from a human perspective, it's not surprising that the visual splendor of this medieval Bible would serve to mirror its deep spiritual, cultural, and societal value.</b> And from a practical perspective, the large manuscripts probably worked well with lecterns at churches and cathedrals, for public, liturgical readings of scripture.</p>

                        <h3>Ô∏è‚ÄçüñäÔ∏èÔ∏è‚Äç Sylvia Plath's Poetry Manuscripts</h3>

                        <p>My favorite manuscript or object in the <b>Treasures Gallery</b> wasn't medieval exactly, nor particularly renowned as an icon of cultural heritage, but it was an original manuscript from the poetry of Sylvia Plath. Plath is one of my favorite poets of all time, with her sheer gift for imagery, voice, and surgically precise and annihilatory language that, with brutal, icy conviction, slices apart the fragile mirage which is human sanity and inner peace. Her writing, force of life, and constellation of poems‚Äînot defined or diminished in any way by the tragedy of her suicide‚Äîhas been a great inspiration for my own. When I learned there was an exhibit for her work, I was very excited and immediately headed over (at least, once I escaped the rather stuffy and crowded <em>Magna Carta </em> room). Incidentally, I had my UK-edition copy of her <em>The Bell Jar</em> (1963) in my backpack, which led to the photograph on the left below, captured by a friend. The right image displays the manuscript of her terse, insidiously unnerving poem <em>Mushrooms</em>, with vintage typewriter font and her full name written at the top in pen.</p>

                        <div style = "display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">

                        <img src="images/plath-manuscript.png" style="object-fit: cover;height:300px; border-radius:10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">

                         <img src="images/plath-2.webp" style="object-fit: cover;height: 300px; border-radius:10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
                        </div>

                        <p>It was wonderful to see her manuscripts celebrated among other treasures and gemstones of the literary canon, from the folios of Shakespeare nearby to fragments of the <em>Beowulf</em> epic, to the portable, foldable mahogany desk where Jane Austen (perhaps apocryphally) wrote <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> and <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. The exhibit also reinvigorated my interest in her later works of poetry, as I had been lately focused on her prose, e.g., <em>The Bell Jar</em>. The next day, when I was back in Oxford, and as usual, inside the capacious Blackwell's bookstore near Trinity College looking for inspiration for my writing, I found her poetry collection <em>Ariel</em> (which I hadn't read in a while), unlatched the cover, and began to read.</p>

                        <h3>üé≠ Shakespeare's First Folio (National Library of Scotland)</h3>

                        <p>This photograph was taken at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh, a few hours after arriving in the city by train. It's a beautiful city, Edinburgh, with its historic buildings and winding cobblestone roads that glitter darkly like Icelandic magma in the rain. The National Library of Scotland is located in the bustling city center; it's a large, imposing building, and one of its crowning exhibits is a rare copy of <em>Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies</em> (1623), or colloquially known as the <em>First Folio</em> of Shakespeare. When I walked in, right after a sumptuous meal of Scottish breakfast, I glanced at a paper map, and took a beeline right to the Folio exhibit.</p>

                        <p>This is a pattern at this point, but I was once again surprised by how large and voluminous the folio was, though I recalled that it contains nearly his entire oeuvre of plays and theater. 36 plays in total! That's an actual epidemic of boredom (just kidding, I really do love Shakespeare's stories, his meticulous meter and prolific puns, and even performed in an abridged Brasenose College showing of <em>Romeo & Juliet</em>, playing my literary namesake Benvolio). Reportedly, only 235 of the original 750 copies remain (I estimate 50% were ragefully destroyed by frustrated English majors), which makes this manuscript very rare indeed. And a delight to look upon. I'm not entirely sure why, in the library exhibit, the folio is opened specifically to the <em>Macbeth</em> play. Why not <em>Romeo & Juliet</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, or <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>?

                        Though given that I'm in Scotland, and the tragedy concerns a King of Scotland (reportedly, among theater performers, one is expressly forbidden to say the cursed name of the play, and must refer to it obliquely as <em>The Scottish Play</em>), I have a hunch. Not a lunch though, so right after gazing at the <em>First Folio</em> through an unreachable waterfall of glass, I went back outside, into the raining Edinburgh, for a nearby fish & chips place‚Äîyum!</p>
