                        <p>Lastly, we have the ultimate work-in-progress: the future. I really don't know what's next for me, but at this very uncertain, fog-shrouded stage of my life, that's probably all right. What I know for sure, what's set in Rosetta stone, is that, like autumn quarter, I'll be TAing a CS course (though a different and much larger one, CS107, on computer systems), and simultaneously teaching the same 1-unit wonder (CS106S), and it's probably going to nearly kill me. But it'll be super fun, and I've started prepping over the winter (<s>completely relearning a programming language I haven't touched in two years, gosh I'm such a fraud</s>)! My hope is to become a CS lecturer somewhere one day, resisting the tidal, ocean-breaking pull which is Silicon Valley, and its sheer magnetism of industry, myth, mirage, and high-tech beckoning. We'll see if I can make it.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>I'm still thinking about taking more literature and English classes, as I haven't given up yet on the celestial moonshot of applying to MFA Programs (Creative Writing).</b> There probably won't be a whole lot of rigorous medieval manuscript or codicology study per se 🙃 (besides the ephemeral trip to the museum, rare books gallery, or national library archives, as my sister is incidentally studying abroad in the UK this winter). But I'm motivated from this course to explore horizontally, to approach literature with a wider, more hemispheric fish-eye lens. On one hand, I think it would help my applications—at least reassure the admissions committee that I'm not a complete cosmic void when it completes to literary study and interest—but moreover, I believe it would enrich and empower my own writing, with a deeper, brighter, more star-filled nebula of stories, epics, and inspiration to draw upon. To that end, some English courses I'm possibly thinking about this year are:

                            <li><span style = "background-color: lightsalmon; border-radius: 5px"><b>ENGLISH 11A</b></span>: Intro to English II: From Milton to the Romantics (Winter ☃️)</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>It's not a prescriptive list, and I'm open to anything! Of course, I'm planning to take CS courses, as humbly asked by my MS requirements, and convincing myself that I'm not completely a fraud as a computer programmer. I think I can do both. Though as of late, my writing has bottomed out, with a gaping void of confidence, and I almost feel like I've completely failed as a writer. My craft never reached a standard that I'm happy with, and I've tried to move away from my current writing style—notorious in workshop for its exuberant, kaleidoscope-bright maximalism, its vain attempts to capture life in endless, eye-tiring 10-metaphor, 100-word sentences that circle and circle inward to an elusive terminating point. I can never end my sentences when I write them. That persistent incompleteness always haunts me. Though, perhaps I'm being too harsh on myself. I started taking English classes just two years ago, and as all my teachers tell me, that's not a whole lot of time to be really good at something, unless you're Albert Einstein, Serena Williams, or a PhD candidate (where 2 years is like 40% of one's funding gone right there, so best to keep going).

                        <p>How exactly I would balance pursuing an MFA degree (in the remote chance I make it in) with teaching and working on computer science, we would have to see. It's probably impossible for me, and a very very dumb idea, but as I've said before, I don't make objectively good decisions in life. That's just my academic identity, a perhaps fatal commitment to the subjective, idealistic, adventurous experience i.e. "doing things for the plot, even if I look like a total idiot". There's this quote I ponder sometimes from the novel <em>The Idiot</em>, by the writer Elif Batuman, who graduated from Stanford with a PhD in comparative literature in 2007 (I'm such a fan of her writing that I've read all her books, have actually read 80 pages of her dissertation LOL, and I have an autographed copy of <em>The Idiot</em> from her campus reading). The quote goes as:</p>

                        <p><em>"For the first time in my life, I couldn't think of anything I particularly wanted to study or to do. I still had the old idea of being a writer, but that was being, not doing. It didn't say what you were supposed to do."</em></p>

                        <p>Relatable af. There's also this particularly striking, famous quote about indecisiveness and a fig tree with endless branches by Sylvia Plath, from her deeply personal novel and roman à clef <em>The Bell Jar</em>, which comes to mind when I think about life, literature, and well-being. Because, honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing, where I'm going into my twenties, and it's already another winter break where my unrealistic expectation of figuring out my entire life has dissipitated. Bah humbug. But my temporary resolution is this. I may be utterly awful at literature, but I haven't seen just how utterly awful I can be yet; I haven't given myself that opportunity, so I'm going to keep going, writing, and drilling into that dark unmapped ocean seafloor of life, where, in some trenches and abysses, if I look deep and aimlessly enough, astonishing, incredible light may appear, pulsating and quivering in the deathly waters, and I will hear from within me that not everything has been hopeless and for nothing. There is always something there. Like fish and chips, and <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> (2024), and the upcoming prestige mockumentary <em>Cunk on Life</em> (2025) in my holiday TV wishlist. Can't wait.</p>

                        <p>Anyway, got to help the family decorate the living room for Christmas Eve tomorrow, so have to head out; <b>cheers, thank you for reading this colossal HTML shitpost-turned-blogpost reflection on manuscripts, literature, and life, and happy holidays!</b></p>
