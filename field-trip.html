                        <h2 id="field-trip">üìö Field Trip to the Stanford Special Collections</h2>

                        <p><em>Oct. 25th, 2024 (Green Library)</em></p>

                        <p>It was a vivid autumn landscape of a day, with fire-red leaves coppering the ground, birds circling the sky, and sunlight glittering, dreamlike, in the wet windswept grasses around Stanford Palm Drive. With this fair weather in mind, I bolted out of the Hewlett Auditorium at 2:25 PM, running slightly behind time to a programmed visit to the Stanford Libraries's Special Collections, at 2:30 PM. Five minutes. <em>Shit</em>. I practically tore my bike from its lock, and ascended up the fast capillary of Jane Stanford Way. I arrived at Green Library with a minute, and a few breadths, to spare. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <div style = "display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
                        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3168.4353867169516!2d-122.17164611114505!3d37.4268182!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x808fbad65b7bfe87%3A0x89342d63a474568f!2sCecil%20H%20Green%20Library!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1734561650222!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="200px" height="200px" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

                        <p>I took another few minutes to find the Special Collections room, which I spent aimlessly wandering hallways and stacks, only to realize that it was (very discreetly) at the rear of Lane Reading Room. How elusive. It felt like passing through a hidden curtain in an old medieval castle (exciting!), but instead of endless emeralds, chests of gold, or the lethal glint of Hamlet's sword on the other side, there was a modest, two-bedroom-sized space with four-story bookshelves wrapping around the walls, generous lighting from above, and a Battleships game arrangement of tables where several manuscript books, couched in foam blocks, lay in waiting. Most of the students in the class had already arrived. They were standing, poring over the volumes before them, in a kind of rapid matchmaking process. I was slightly late to the game.

                        <p>The exercise was helmed by the kind Special Collection librarian and rare books curator, incidentally also named Benjamin. It's always nice to meet another friendly Ben, especially when it confuses the class professor. I showed him the manuscript book I was looking at currently, which was a large tome with big, blocky letters, and manuscript pages that, despite their age, were astonishingly bereft of visible erosions and corrosions, producing a near skeletal white color. 
                        </p>

                        <p>"It's a shame I can't read Latin," I said. </p>
                        <p>"That French," he replied. </p>
                        <p>I moved onto another manuscript. </p>

                        <p>The manuscript book that I ended up with was at the back fringe of the reading room. Catalogued as <b>MSS Codex 1261: Ferial Psalter</b> in the decorated Stanford special collections, the manuscript was a palm-sized book of psalms. It was layers and layers of prayers, etched in dark, delicate ink on parchment, now centuries-old, now discoloring and browning like soft, soft leaves in the death throes of autumn. But even in its aged, its august and mildewed condition, it's a work worthy of inspection, introspection‚Äîfor it's a fascinatingly intimate object as a medieval instrument of prayer, and a channel for one's personal connection with the very voice of God.

                        <p><em>Inside leaves of the collection's Book of Hours. My hand is gently pressing down on the verso and recto leaves, as otherwise they would close upward like a clam shell. This was actually a perennial issue with taking photographs, as the super-senior 600-year-old manuscript leafs often did not want to cooperate with me.</em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>As I couldn't read the Latin text inside the book (such a shame), I began to look for external clues. Beginning with the title "Ferial Psalter", written on the protective cover that the book was sheathed inside, I looked up both words on my phone, which has the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> app placed right between <em>Subway Surfers</em> and <em>Mario Kart</em>. I'm a true professional at this. <s>I feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes.</s> So according to the <em>OED</em>, "Ferial", from the French f√©rial and Latin 'feria', meaning holiday, is an adjective that, in a clergical context, actually means pertaining to the ordinary weekdays that weren't festivals or feasts [1]. The noun "psalter" refers to a (in this case, Latin) translation of the Book of Psalms from the Old Testament [2], as intended for liturgical uses. Accordingly, within the Ferial Psalter is a repository of psalms, litanies, and prayers for daily, monastically regular use. These psalms, as displayed in the images above, are demarcated by 12 zodiac symbols [4] (e.g., <em>Taurus, Gemini, Capricorn</em> in the images) for the months they are to be read, setting a cadence and disciplined temporality along with the late-medieval canonical hours for prayer.</p>
                        <p>From the perspective of physical materiality, the Ferial Psalter is also intruging. The hard cover is a deep, igneous red, with a worn-down leather lock, and, to assure durability of the book binding, three raised cords on its spine, like giant ridges one may find on museum-grade dinosaur bones. On both the front and back covers, there are four fleur-de-lis markings arranged in a lozenge, with an obloid stamp in the center, possibly of ecclesiastical or religious origin. <b>The ornate and diary-like exterior of the prayer book, along with the rusted metal latch, connotates a sense of privacy, confidentiality, and spiritual propinquity, reflecting the very personal and exigent nature of prayer.</b> It's important to consider the very design and architectural choices of the text object, I think. At first, I was surprised by the lack of miniatures and illustrations within the prayer book, but given its purpose as a devotional, deeply meditatory document, it ostensibly makes more sense to me for the book to be less decorative and flashy in the interior. The words will suffice.</p>

                        <p><em>Front (left) and back (right) cover of the collection's Book of Hours</em></p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>But still, I couldn't actually read any text in the book, and sensing the (perennially) confused look on my face, the librarian generously gave me a few printed handouts. They covered scholarship and manuscript research practices regarding the Latin Book of Hours, interpreting the calendar symbols throughout the text for when each psalm and prayer should be read, and the particular lexicon (e.g., <em>antiphon, litanies, penitential psalms, matins</em>) used in the academic and historical study of prayer books. He also admitted the Book of Hours is a challenging manuscript analytically, especially for newcomers, which was comforting to hear. Eventually, I took a lazy beeline into the Stanford Searchworks catalogue, and just searched up the manuscript object. I then descended into a rabbit hole regarding the book and its vague history, which I'll summarize by saying it's a 15th century manuscript of 117 paper leaves, brown ink Gothic script, and was only bound in the 16th century (with the spine undergoing repair since then) [3], so for years it existed molecularized, fragmented. It was contributed to the Stanford collections by its former owner Comte Folchi, who engraved a bookplate with the motto "impavidum ferient", which roughly transmutes from the Latin into "they will strike fearlessly". Fascinating stuff.</p>

                        <p>Though my manuscripts research objective, my efforts at a vein or inkling of very original scholarship, for the day had failed. Sad stuff. At least I tried my best, though I did learn a great deal about physical manuscripts study and preliminary research, the ecclesiastical aspects of the Latin Books of Hours, and <b>doing your best even when you're just academically rudderless, stranded at sea and desperately scanning the stars for a way back to comfort.</b> I was way outside my comfort zone academically‚Äîwhich isn't intrinsically a bad thing, it's just necessary to find a balance, a median in the up and down cardiogram of learning new material and subjects. And so I went back to my room, watched anime on my couch for four hours, wasting away and retreating into an illusion, an <em>isekai</em> world of magic (the same thing I do when I fail an exam, can't make a shred of progress on a paper, or feel crushingly lonely and directionless in life). I soon drifted to sleep, forgot everything in my dreams, and woke up the next morning to an oasis-blue dawn, a sunrise shimmering with bliss, and a beautiful, beautiful day ahead üå±üå±üå±.</p>
